By downloading, accessing, or using PolyglAI, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Use. Please read them carefully before continuing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Purpose of PolyglAI</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              PolyglAI is an educational tool developed for language learning and pronunciation improvement through artificial intelligence. The app integrates Microsoft Azure Speech AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (OCR), and Document Intelligence technologies to provide interactive and data-driven language learning. The system is intended for personal and educational use only and may not be used for commercial purposes without written consent from the developers.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Eligibility and Age Requirement</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              PolyglAI is designed for learners of all ages. However, in compliance with the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and related international standards, users under 13 years old are required to use the app under parental or guardian supervision. By using PolyglAI, you confirm that you meet this requirement or have obtained consent from a parent or legal guardian.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. User Responsibilities</h2>

            </ul>

              PolyglAI collects only essential data to improve user experience, including demographic details provided during onboarding (age, gender, profession, and location).

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Content and Educational Materials</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              All translations, pronunciations, and vocabulary materials are provided for educational use. While the developers strive for accuracy, translations or AI-generated content may occasionally contain errors. Users are advised to apply personal discretion and cross-reference critical translations in professional or formal use.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Accessibility and Availability</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              PolyglAI is provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available.&quot; The developers aim to maintain consistent functionality but cannot guarantee uninterrupted access due to technical maintenance, server downtime, or updates.
            </p>
